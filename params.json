{"name":"Ozp-webtop","tagline":"OZONE Platform Web Desktop","body":"# ozp-webtop\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ozone-development/ozp-webtop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ozone-development/ozp-webtop)\r\n\r\nNext Gen OZONE UI\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nInstall Node.js and npm. Head over to [the Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) if you need to do that.\r\nNext, install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) with the command below.\r\n\r\n    (sudo) npm install -g bower grunt-cli\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nFirst clone the repo. Then install development dependencies with npm. Install frontend app dependencies with Bower:\r\n\r\n    cd ozp-webtop\r\n    npm install && bower install\r\n    \r\nDevelopment tasks are run with Grunt. Run `grunt serve` to bring up a live preview of the webtop. Run `grunt -h` for a full list of Grunt tasks.\r\n\r\n## Development Notes\r\n\r\n### Use of Yeoman\r\nThis app was scaffolded with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). You may want to install it to aid in contributing to this repo. You can install it with npm with the following commands:\r\n\r\n    (sudo) npm install -g yo generator-angular\r\n    \r\nIf you install `yo`, it will install Grunt and Bower for you. You can then scaffold out new pieces of the app with:\r\n\r\n    cd ozp-webtop\r\n    yo angular:directive myNewDirective\r\n    \r\nYou can find more at the `generator-angular` [Github repo](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).\r\n\r\n### Directory Structure\r\nThe directory structure is a result of the Yeoman scaffolding, however some additional directories have been added. The app is structured in the following way:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp/            \r\n    examples/       # HTML to use as webtop frames\r\n    fonts/          # Provided by Yeoman\r\n    images/         # Placeholder images \r\n    mock/           # JSON which mocks a server response\r\n    scripts/        # Contains JavaScript with Angular pieces of the application\r\n        ...\r\n    templates/      # Templates are HTML fragments that are used by one or more directives\r\n    views/          # HTML which corresponds to a route. A view is the composite of HTML and many directives\r\ntest/ \r\n    runner.html     # Spec runner\r\n    spec/           # Child directories correspond to the code in app/scripts/         \r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Copyrights\r\n> Software (c) 2014 [Department of Defense](http://defense.gov/ \"DoD\")\r\n\r\n> The United States Government has unlimited rights in this software.  \r\n \r\nThe OZONE Platform Webtop is released to the public as Open Source Software, because it's the Right Thing To Do.
